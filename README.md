# Climate
Climate is designed to measure humidity, temperature, and particles in the air. With these measurements, one can get an indication of the state of the indoor climate. Our device sends alerts when conditions exceed threshold values, making it possible to take action in time. Similar to a smoke detector, it is inexpensive and can potentially lead to significant economic savings by preventing damage.

This makes Climate an invaluable tool for anyone looking to protect their home and health by keeping the indoor climate optimal and free of mold.
